Secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival.Results 390 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=194) or the standard treatment group (n=196). At median follow-up of 39.9 months (interquartile range 36.8-43.4 months), progression-free survival was higher in the camrelizumab group than the standard treatment group (36 months: 83.4\%, 95\% confidence interval 78.3\% to 88.8\% v 71.3\%, 65.2\% to 77.9\%; stratified hazard ratio 0.51, 95\% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77, P=0.001). The incidence of acute and late adverse events (grade 3 or 4) was 50.5\% and 3.2\% in the camrelizumab group compared with 48.7\% and 3.7\% in the standard treatment group. Immunological adverse events (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 19 patients (10.2\%) in the camrelizumab group.Conclusion The addition of camrelizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment improved progression-free survival among patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after induction chemotherapy.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04453826The code used to analyse the data in the paper can be found in the supplemental files.

               large language models (LLMs) to provide medical advice to the
               public. LLMs now achieve nearly perfect scores on medical
               licensing exams, but this does not necessarily translate to
               accurate performance in real-world settings. We tested whether
               LLMs can assist members of the public in identifying underlying
               conditions and choosing a course of action (disposition) in ten
               medical scenarios in a controlled study with 1,298 participants.
               Participants were randomly assigned to receive assistance from an
               LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) or a source of their choice
               (control). Tested alone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately,
               correctly identifying conditions in 94.9\% of cases and
               disposition in 56.3\% on average. However, participants using the
               same LLMs identified relevant conditions in fewer than 34.5\% of
               cases and disposition in fewer than 44.2\%, both no better than
               the control group. We identify user interactions as a challenge
               to the deployment of LLMs for medical advice. Standard benchmarks
               for medical knowledge and simulated patient interactions do not
               predict the failures we find with human participants. Moving
               forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate
               interactive capabilities before public deployments in healthcare.",
