# Statistical Principles from JAMA Instructions for Authors

JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) provides comprehensive guidelines for statistical reporting in clinical research. The following principles are extracted from JAMA's instructions for authors.

## Key Statistical Principles

1. **Study Design and Reporting**
   - Clearly state the study design in the title, abstract, and methods
   - Follow appropriate reporting guidelines (CONSORT for randomized trials, STROBE for observational studies, etc.)
   - Preregistration of study protocols is strongly encouraged

2. **Sample Size and Power**
   - Report how sample size was determined
   - Include power calculations and assumptions
   - For negative studies, discuss whether the study was adequately powered

3. **Statistical Methods Description**
   - Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader to verify the results
   - Specify the statistical software package(s) and versions used
   - Define all statistical terms, abbreviations, and symbols

4. **Data Presentation**
   - Present data with appropriate precision
   - Report actual P values rather than thresholds (e.g., P = .04 rather than P < .05)
   - Include confidence intervals for main outcomes
   - Avoid reporting only P values without effect sizes

5. **Multiple Comparisons**
   - Account for multiple comparisons when appropriate
   - Clearly distinguish between prespecified and post hoc analyses
   - Adjust P values or confidence intervals when multiple tests are performed

6. **Missing Data Handling**
   - Report the amount of missing data
   - Describe methods used to address missing data
   - Consider sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data

7. **Subgroup Analyses**
   - Prespecify subgroup analyses when possible
   - Use appropriate tests for interaction
   - Interpret subgroup findings cautiously, especially if not prespecified

8. **Measures of Association**
   - Report appropriate measures of association (e.g., relative risks, odds ratios, hazard ratios)
   - Include absolute differences when reporting relative measures
   - Provide appropriate adjustments for confounding variables

9. **Regression Analyses**
   - Describe model building strategies
   - Report how continuous variables were handled
   - Assess model assumptions and fit
   - For multivariable analyses, report all variables in the model

10. **Survival Analyses**
    - Report median follow-up time
    - Consider competing risks when appropriate
    - Assess proportional hazards assumptions for Cox models
    - Present Kaplan-Meier curves for key outcomes

11. **Figures and Tables**
    - Use figures and tables to present data clearly and efficiently
    - Include appropriate measures of variability in figures
    - Provide clear legends and footnotes explaining all abbreviations

12. **Limitations and Interpretation**
    - Acknowledge study limitations
    - Discuss potential sources of bias
    - Interpret findings in context of study design and previous literature
    - Avoid causal language for observational studies
