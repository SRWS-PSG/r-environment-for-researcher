# Analysis Intake

- Ask for the study goal and how results will be used (descriptive, prognostic, prediction, causal, exploratory).
- Ask for study design and unit of analysis; confirm independence, clustering, or repeated measures.
- Ask for outcome definition: type, timing, censoring rules, and event coding meaning.
- Ask for exposure or intervention definition, start time, and whether it is time-varying.
- Ask for adjustment candidates and the rationale for including or excluding variables.
- Ask for variable coding details (0/1 meaning), units, and sentinel values (e.g., 999).
- Ask about missingness amount, suspected mechanism, and exclusion criteria.
- Ask for reporting needs: effect measure, 95% CI, and expected tables or figures (Table 1, regression tables, KM curves, balance plots).
- Ask for a data dictionary or codebook and the data file location.
