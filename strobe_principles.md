# Statistical Principles from STROBE Statement

The STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) Statement provides guidelines for reporting observational studies in epidemiology, including cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.

## Key Statistical Principles

1. **Clear Description of Study Design**
   - Clearly state the study design (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) in the title or abstract
   - Present key elements of study design early in the paper

2. **Participant Selection and Eligibility Criteria**
   - Define eligibility criteria and sources/methods of participant selection
   - Describe methods of follow-up for cohort studies
   - For case-control studies, provide rationale for case and control selection
   - For matched studies, describe matching criteria and number of exposed/unexposed

3. **Variable Definition and Measurement**
   - Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers
   - Provide detailed information on assessment methods for each variable
   - Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group

4. **Statistical Methods Reporting**
   - Describe all statistical methods in detail, including those used to control for confounding
   - Explain how missing data were addressed
   - For cohort studies, describe how loss to follow-up was addressed
   - For case-control studies, explain how matching was addressed in analyses
   - For cross-sectional studies, describe analytical methods taking sampling strategy into account

5. **Sample Size Determination**
   - Explain how the study size was determined
   - Describe any sensitivity analyses

6. **Quantitative Variables Handling**
   - Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses
   - Describe which groupings were chosen and why, if applicable

7. **Addressing Potential Biases**
   - Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias
   - Discuss direction and magnitude of potential biases

8. **Descriptive Data Presentation**
   - Report numbers of individuals at each stage of the study
   - Consider using a flow diagram
   - Report characteristics of study participants and information on exposures and potential confounders
   - Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest

9. **Outcome Data Reporting**
   - Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time
   - For cohort studies, report summary measures of follow-up time

10. **Main Results Presentation**
    - Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates
    - Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized
    - Consider translating relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period

11. **Other Analyses Reporting**
    - Report other analyses performed (e.g., subgroups, interactions, sensitivity analyses)

12. **Limitations Discussion**
    - Discuss limitations of the study, addressing sources of potential bias or imprecision
    - Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias

13. **Cautious Interpretation**
    - Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence

14. **Generalizability Assessment**
    - Discuss the generalizability (external validity) of the study results

15. **Funding and Role Disclosure**
    - Report sources of funding and the role of the funders in the study
